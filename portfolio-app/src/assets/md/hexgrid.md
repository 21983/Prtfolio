# hexgrid

This is a project where i made a hexagongrid in unity C#. You can change the color of a hexagon by clicking on it.
It's a simple project to learn how to make a grid out of hexagons.

## What did I do and learn?

### Hexagon mesh creation

I haven't really worked with changing mesh that much before so i had to figure out how to make the mesh to a hexagon.
Eventually i figured out how to make the hexagon mesh and after that it wasn't that hard to do the same with the collider.

### Hexagon grid

I have made grids before but never with hexagons. It wasn't that much different than a normal grid except that you have to give an offset every other row.
