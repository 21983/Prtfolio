# Inventory System

In this project i made an inventory system for the command line. You can just do basic things 
like adding an item, using it, seeing what's in your inventory and deleting an item.

## What did I do and learn?


### C++

I barely had any knowledge of C++ before i started this project. I really wanted to learn more about C++ and i thought this was a good way to start. 

### Lists/Iterators

At first I used a list to put in all items, but somehow it made it crash when i deleted an Item. I didn't know what caused it. So after that i made a pointer list. if i wanted to delete it i used the pointer and then removed the pointer from the list.

I used iterators to go through the list. first it was somewhat challenging to use them but i got used to them pretty quickly.
