# Inventory System

In this project, I made an inventory system for the command line. You can just do basic things 
like adding an item, using it, seeing what's in your inventory and deleting an item.

## What did I do and learn?


### C++

I barely had any knowledge of C++ before I started this project. I really wanted to learn more about C++ and I thought this was a good way to start. 

### Lists/Iterators

At first, I used a list to put in all items, but somehow it made it crash when I deleted an Item. I didn't know what caused it. So after that, I made a pointer list. if I wanted to delete it II used the pointer and then removed the pointer from the list.

I used iterators to go through the list. first, it was somewhat challenging to use them but I got used to them pretty quickly.
