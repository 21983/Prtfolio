# Space Omelette

Oxygen is a project where we made a platformer. The goal is to pick up all the parts and go through a portal. At the end of the stage you can repair your spaceship. You can die if you fall of the map or walk/jump against a trap. We made our levels with tiles you can place down. If you complete level 6 you fly of and you crash on another planet where you also have to pass 6 levels. 

## Basic programming

This project was made after 10 months of programming experience. 
I still had to learn a lot about basic programming which i did.
