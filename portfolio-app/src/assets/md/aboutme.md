#Joppe van Basten

I'm Joppe van Basten. I'm from April 2000, I attend a course for game-developtment at the Media College of Amsterdam. I'm in the third year and I have picked up experience on an arrangement of different skills. 

I have especially worked a lot with Unity (C#). I also have experience with Javascript, C++, Java and PHP. Working in groups is what I also love to do and working together in a group is one of my strengths. I love working on functional things more than visual things. I normally don't put a lot of time in to making a game/project look visually attractive. I always want to go straight to the code without losing to much time on sprites and animations. Of course if the project has to look good I try to make it as good as possible.

I hope to learn a lot more about programming the next few years.
