#Joppe van Basten

I'm Joppe van Basten. I'm 18 years old, I attend a course for game-developtment at the Media College of Amsterdam. I'm in the third year and I have picked up experience on an arrangement of different skills, I have especially worked a lot with Unity (C#). I also have experience with Javascript, C++, Java and PHP. Working in groups is what I also love to do and working together in a group is one of my strengths. I hope to learn a lot more about programming the next few years.
