# Minesweeper

Minesweeper was a project especially to learn about the Floodfill algorithm.
I made this project alone in a couple of days.

## What did I do and learn?

### 2D Arrays

I haven't worked with 2D arrays a lot before this project. It wasn't to hard to figure out how to make the grid with an 2D array though. 

### Flood-fill algorithm

I didn't know about the flood-fill algorithm before this. After i did some research it wasn't too hard to use it.
