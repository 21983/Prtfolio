# Minesweeper

Minesweeper was a school project where we had to make. Minesweeper especially to learn about the Floodfill algorithm.
I made this project with

## What did I do and learn?

### Webpack

Having barely used node or npm, I decided to use typescript and webpack to bundle my scripts and site. In hindsight this project would probably be easier to develop if I didn't use Webpack, but it was a good learning experience on how to use it, and I'll try and learn more about it in future projects. It did make using different classes in multiple files much easier and I appreciate that.

### Typescript

This was the first time I used Typescript, and as I really like statically typed programming language, this was no exception. Sometimes it was quite troublesome to work around it and I had to cast some objects to others, but it in the end is no problem and makes the code easier to read than with Javascript itself. 

### Flood-fill algorithm

I've known about the flood-fill algorithm before, but I've never used it in practice. It's actually just as simple as I thought and just as cool.
