# Applied Mathematics

These are some projects using applied mathematics in javascript.

## What did I do and learn?

### Inequality

Here you have 2 balls that make a line and a third ball that changes color depending on if it's above or under the line.

### Intersection

This one has 2 lines between 4 balls and it looks if there is an intersection between the lines. If there is an intersection it places a small ball where the intersection is.

### Perpendicular

There is one line between 2 balls and a third ball that has a line that is always perpendicular to the other line.

### 2 Vectors

I made 2 Vectors that you can adjust with 3 balls and a third vector that is the 2 Vectors added together.
